#Ben Gass

#### Studying JavaScript as part of my efforts to become a web developer. The work seems satisfying, challenging and enjoyable. 
#### So far I've produced a roman numeral to int converter using python and a object oriented blackjack game using JS (which I intend to tinker with and improve card sprites & variable values for aces). Other than some cursory Python and some more javascript I've also studied some HTML, CSS and am learning JQuery.
#### As for creative ambitions I'd like to make some fun, attractive and quality websites such as Carpets for Airports (http://carpetsforairports.com/)
