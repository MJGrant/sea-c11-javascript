*My name is Destiny Boyer and I am from Seattle, Washington. I don't have a very extensive background in coding but I think it is a useful skill and will enable me to travel if I pursue it as a career. Currently I work full time as an Escrow Coordinator and have declared as a Chemical Engineering major. However, after talking with a few engineers I decided that being stuck on a quality control line or in a lab all day doesn't appeal to me. So I'm exploring an trying new things.*
