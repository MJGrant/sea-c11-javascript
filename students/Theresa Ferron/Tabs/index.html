    <div id="Lexi">
        <p>Alexandria Rose - known as Lexi - is 15 going on 25. She is a fun-loving teenager who values family more than most kids her age. She is an amazing big sister, a wonderful friend, and a fabulous daughter...except when she's not.</p>

    <div id="Tien">
        <p>Sebastien Michael Jonathan - or Tien - is a wonderfully kind and empathetic little man, with a bit of a quirky side. He rarely gets angry, and is the one who can calm down any member of the family. He loves to travel and hike, and has more stamina than anyone I've ever met.</p>

    <div id="Ella">
        <p>Isabella Jolie is like 50 pounds of dynomite in a 3 pound package. She is kind and sweet when she chooses to be, but under the sweet face and pretty blue eyes lies a serious force to be reckoned with. Her leadership abilities are phenomenal. She idolizes her big brother and loves taking care of her little sister.</p>

    <div id="Nika">
        <p>Annika Kyriel is a cuddle bug with a stubborn streak. Usually very sweet, attentive, and kind, she occasionally turns into a mini tyrant with a good sense of humor. She is spoiled rotton, and positive she's going to be a princess when she grows up. She loves singing and dancing, and playing outside with her brother.</p>
