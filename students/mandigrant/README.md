Hello, my name is Mandi! I'm a game industry veteran with 8 years as a designer and artist. It's become rather routine so I'm looking for a change of scenery!

I like: niche blogging, digital painting, building web sites, UX, and tinkering with computers. I hope this class will help on my journey to tie all those things together with coding skills!
