Hello, my name Derek and I am recent transplant from Minneapolis, MN. I am excited to be here at Javascript foundations 2.
Back home I helped run a lawn care business with my Father. I recently heard about Codefellows and decided to make the career  
jump. I have always been interested in Programming and code while following my older sister in her programming career.
I am working hard to learn programming as fast as i can, due to the exciting news of my wife expecting twins in october.
I am also excited to meet and work with new friends and people here in JavaScript F2 course.
